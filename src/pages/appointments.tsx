          To book an appointment, we have to set the following required
          informations: the practitioner, the patient and date.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend implementation is already done, you have all necessary
          routes to work and implement requested features.
        </p>
        <p>
          In first you have to create the appointment form. You are free to use
          the validation form that you want like Formik or React-hook-form.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second time, you will show the list of all created appointments
          on the right side
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't have mock ups, you have to design your own solution and
          propose a simple workflow for users. It also should be responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect you to implement two bonus features: you can choose among
          the suggested features in the bonus section or choose to implement one
          of your choice.
